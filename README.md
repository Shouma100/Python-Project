Every year, millions of individuals are impacted by the global health catastrophe known as cancer. This is approximately one third of all total deaths worldwide [1].  Nearly 20 million new cases of cancer and 9.7 million fatalities were reported globally in 2022; by 2050, there would likely be an estimated 35 million new cases annually. Breast cancer and lung cancer continue to be the most often diagnosed types. There will be 972,060 new cases among women. Adolescents (ages 15–19) and children (years 0–14) account for a smaller percentage of all diagnoses, with some malignancies such brain tumours and leukaemia being the most prevalent among them. Consult organisations like the CDC and American Cancer Society for more information on cancer statistics, especially those by age group. Early cancer detection greatly improves the chance of a successful course of therapy; nevertheless, present diagnostic techniques frequently have drawbacks, including exorbitant costs, drawn-out processes, and inconsistent outcomes. Despite their effectiveness, genetic testing, biopsy analysis, and medical imaging require a lot of resources and are prone to delays and human error.
 These numbers demonstrate the critical need for improved early detection techniques, especially in areas with limited access to medical care. By analysing medical data, machine learning (ML) approaches enable quicker and more accurate diagnoses, which presents intriguing solutions [2] [3]. Due to the availability of more data in the field of healthcare and improvements to machine learning methods, risks of various diseases have become predicted as a promising tool. Machine learning can improve the accuracy of cancer detection by using techniques like feature selection to improve the predictive power of models, outlier identification to clean the data, and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to solve class imbalance [4],These models' robustness and dependability are ensured via hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, providing hope for better cancer care and treatment outcomes [5] [6]. Secondly, tuning of the parameters of the ML model to enhance its accuracy without putting too much effort into building an overly complex model is a fundamental problem in this field.

The main idea is to help people to develop a reliable machine learning model of predicting the risk of a  cancer based on their health conditions and habits. To do this we want to take the following steps in order to use data driven techniques/ approaches to solve a few important problems in cancer prediction. Decomposition of large data sets into groups of normal and special cases of outliers techniques will enhance the global prediction capability and reduce the distorted effect of outliers. Again to reduce the computational burden and noise while not reducing the predictive ability, feature selection will also be used in order to select the relevant predictors. Several important phases are under consideration of the methodology for cancer prediction. To begin with, the techniques such as imputation or removal are applied in order to address cases when a value is missing in a dataset. In order to reduce their impact, outliers identify and limit them.

This work provides a very useful input to the field of healthcare improved predictions with features such as balanced and noisy data through the methods of Machine Learning and AI. Risk evaluation gets boosted with methods like SMOTE [7], Outlier Detection [8], and the feature selection method [9], which helps healthcare gurus to easily isolate high-risk clients, and apply preventive measures. The study also provides understanding of the magnitude and nature of potential risk factors in identifying individuals and thus contributes to clinical management and population health planning. Lastly, it could help cut down on cancer mortality since the focus can be put on the right individual at the right time, and the right intervention can be delivered.
